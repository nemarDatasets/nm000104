  "description": "emg2qwerty is a large-scale surface electromyography (sEMG) dataset comprising 1,135 sessions from 108 participants performing touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard. The dataset contains 5.26 million keystroke events recorded from wrist-mounted 32-channel sEMG devices, totaling 346.4 hours of data. Designed to enable keyboard-free text input through direct decoding of typing intent from neuromuscular activity, this dataset supports research in sequence-to-sequence learning, cross-user generalization, domain adaptation, and high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces for AR/VR and accessibility applications.",
  "methods_description": "Participants performed touch typing on an Apple Magic Keyboard while wearing two sEMG Research Devices (one per wrist), each with 16 differential electrode pairs sampled at 2000 Hz with 12-bit resolution. Text prompts consisted of random dictionary words and Wikipedia sentences. Ground truth keystrokes were recorded via keylogger with ±0.5 ms precision. Between sessions, electrode bands were completely removed and re-donned to simulate realistic electrode placement variability. High-pass filtering at 40 Hz, clock drift correction, and temporal alignment were applied during preprocessing.",
