  "title": "emg2qwerty: A Large Dataset with Baselines for Touch Typing using Surface Electromyography",
  "description": "emg2qwerty is the largest public surface electromyography (sEMG) dataset to date, comprising 1,135 sessions from 108 participants performing touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard. The dataset captures wrist-based sEMG signals (32 channels, 2000 Hz sampling rate) synchronized with keystroke ground truth, totaling 346.4 hours of data and 5.26 million keystrokes. Designed to enable keyboard-free text input through decoding of typing intent from neuromuscular activity, the dataset supports research in sequence-to-sequence learning, cross-user generalization, domain adaptation, and neuromotor interfaces for AR/VR and accessibility applications.",
  "methods_description": "Participants performed touch typing on an Apple Magic Keyboard while wearing two sEMG Research Devices (one per wrist), each with 16 dry gold-plated differential electrode pairs sampled at 2000 Hz with 12-bit resolution and ±6.6 mV dynamic range. Keystrokes were recorded via keylogger with ±0.5 ms precision. Text prompts consisted of random dictionary words and filtered Wikipedia sentences. Sessions lasted 9.5-47.5 minutes depending on typing speed. Between sessions, wristbands were completely removed and re-donned to simulate realistic electrode placement variability. Preprocessing included 40 Hz high-pass filtering, clock drift correction, and temporal alignment between devices.",
